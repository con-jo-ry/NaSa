# Chanting the Names of Mañjuśrī  

## Scribe/translator's homage:

Homage to ever-youthful Mañjuśrī!  


## 1. The request  
And then Vajradhara, the glorious,  
Supreme subduer of the hard to tame,  
The hero conquering the triple world,  
The vajra lord and master of secrets, (1)  


With eyes wide open like white lotuses,   
And a face that's like a lily in full bloom,  
Shaking about an excellent vajra  
Over and over again with his two hands— (2)  


Accompanied by countless Vajrapāṇis,  
With features such as fierce, turbulent frowns,  
Heroes, subduers of the hard to tame,  
Appearing with heroic, hideous forms, (3)  


And shaking in their hands their great vajras,  
The tips of which shine forth intensively,  
Great benefactors to all living beings  
Through skill, through insight, and through great compassion, (4)  

With pleased and happy attitudes, joyful,  
Their bodies those of wrathful deities,  
Protectors who assist the buddhas' deeds,  
Bowing their bodies reverentially—(5)  

Paid homage to the fully awakened one,  
Protector, Blessed One, *tathāgata*.  
And joining his two palms respectfully,  
He said before the lord the following: (6)  


'O omnipresent lord, for my welfare,  
Out of concern for me and for my sake,  
That I may reach complete awakening  
Upon the basis of Illusion's Net;[^7-1] (7)  

[^7-1]: "Illusion's Net" can be understood as a proper name referring to the *Māyājālatantra* and the tantric system presented therein. Various esoteric and non-esoteric glosses of this name are possible: for example, Vimalamitra states that the word hints at the unity of a special form of insight and means.  


And for the sake of every living being—  
Sunk deep into the mud of ignorance,  
Their thoughts disturbed by various afflictions—  
So that they may obtain the highest fruit, (8)  

May you—the most supreme awakened one,  
The Blessed One, the world's guru, teacher,  
Who knows the great *samaya*'s reality,  
Aware of wishes and abilities—(9)  


Please teach to us the great name chanting of  
The wisdom body of the Blessed One,  
The great *uṣṇīṣa*, master of all speech,  
The self-arising wisdom incarnation,  
The wisdom deity called Mañjuśrī; (10)  

These names with meaning both profound and vast;  
Of great significance; peerless; tranquil;   
Good at their start, their middle, and their end; (11)  


Proclaimed by buddhas of the aeons past,  
And to be taught by buddhas yet to come;  
And spoken not once but time and time again  
By all the buddhas of the present age; (12)  

Which were respectfully recited in  
This most supreme tantra, *Illusion's Net*,  
By great Vajrapāṇis, beyond number,  
Joyous upholders of the secret mantras. (13)  


And this I shall uphold with firm resolve,  
Until I reach my final liberation,  
So that I may become, O great protector,  
Upholder of the buddhas' every secret; (14)  


In order to relieve every affliction,  
So that all ignorance may be dispelled,  
I shall reveal this to all living beings  
According to each one's capacity.' (15)  


Having so spoken to the Thus Gone One,  
The master of secrets, Vajrapāṇi,  
Palms pressed together in due reverence,  
Stood with his body bowed before the lord. (16)  

## 2. The Reply  

And then the Blessed One, lord Śākyamuni,  
The best of men, the fully awakened one,  
Extending from his mouth his handsome tongue,  
A tongue unmatched in both its breadth and length, (17)  


Showing a gentle smile to living beings—  
A smile that fills the threefold world with light;  
That tames the four Māras, the enemy;  
That ends unwanted birth in its three forms[^18-1]—(18)  

[^18-1]: The 'three forms of unwanted birth' are birth in hell, as a hungry ghost, or as an animal.


With his sweet-sounding voice, like that of Brahmā,  
Filling all reaches of the triple world,  
Replied as follows to the lord of secrets,  
To Vajrapāṇi, strongest of the strong: (19)  


'That you, abounding in supreme compassion  
And aiming to assist all living beings,  
Are willing and prepared to hear from me  
The chanting of the names, so filled with meaning, (20)  


Of Mañjuśrī's wisdom embodiment—  
Chanting which purifies, which quells all evil—  
That is most excellent, Vajradhara;  
Most excellent of you, Vajrapāṇi! (21)  

And so, O master of secrets, I shall  
Teach this to you in a way most excellent.  
Listen to it with single-minded focus.'  
'How excellent!' replied Vajrapāṇi,  
That is most excellent, O Blessed One.' (22)  

## 3. The survey of the six families  

And then the Blessed One, lord Śākyamuni,  
Surveyed in full the family great with mantras,  
The family that upholds *vidyā*s and *mantra*s,  
The family that by nature is threefold, (23)  

The family of and yet beyond the world,  
The family great in brightening the world,  
The foremost family of *mahāmudrā*,  
Along with the great *uṣṇīṣa*'s great family. (24)  

## 4. The stages of awakening according to Illusion's Net  

And then, about the lord of speech,[^25-1] he spoke  
These verses, which include six kingly mantras,[^25-2]  
Which manifest from non-duality,  
Which bear the quality of non-arising: (25)  

[^25-1]: Vimalamitra, as well as the witnesses we have consulted of the *Nāmasaṅgīti*'s Tibetan translations, indicates that 'the lord of speech' is the Buddha: i.e., 'the Buddha, the lord of speech, spoke these verses'. Vilāsavajra and the Sanskrit witnesses of the Nāmasaṅgīti, however, indicate that 'the lord of speech' refers to Mañjuśrī. The latter reading and interpretation are, in our opinion, preferable on the grounds of grammar and sense, and we therefore reflect it in our English translation. 
[^25-2]: The six mantra are expressed in verse 27.  


*a ā i ī u ū e ai*   
*o au aṃ aḥ sthito hṛdi* |  
*jñāna-mūrtir ahaṃ buddho*   
*buddhānāṃ trya-dhva-vartinām* ||[^26-1] (26)  

[^26-1]: This mantra can be translated as follows: *a ā i ī u ū e ai o au aṃ aḥ*—I, the Buddha, located in the heart, am the wisdom body of all buddhas residing throughout the past, present, and future. 


*oṁ vajra-tīkṣṇa duḥkha-ccheda*  
*prajñā-jñāna-mūrtaye*  
*jñāna-kāya* *vāgī-śvara*  
*arapacanāye te namaḥ* |[^27-1] (27)  

[^27-1]: This mantra can be translated as follow: *Oṁ*, homage to you, Arapacana—Vajratīkṣṇa ('vajra-sharp'), Duḥkhaccheda ('eliminator of suffering'), Prajñājñānamūrti ('embodiment of insight-wisdom'), Jñānakāya ('wisdom body'), Vāgīśvara ('lord of speech')!  

## 5. The great Vajradhātu *maṇḍala*

And so, he is the Blessed One, the Buddha,  
Fully awakened, born of the letter *a*;  
He is the letter *a*, the foremost phoneme,[^28-1]  
Supreme-most syllable of great meaning, (28)  

[^28-1]: The Sanskrit word *akṣara* (letter/phoneme/syllable) can also be understood to refer to an imperishable thing. This understanding is reflected in the Kangyur's translation of the *Nāmasaṅgīti*: i.e., 'He is the ultimate, imperishable thing'.  


Without arising, from great vital force,[^29-1]  
Beyond any expression based on words,  
The foremost cause of every form of speech,  
The shining forth of language of all types, (29)  

[^29-1]: When used in reference to letters, the word *mahāprāṇa* means 'aspiration', which would normally not apply to a vowel such as *a*. Vimalamitra explains that the vowel *a* is unique in not depending on the teeth, nose, tongue, and so on for its articulation; rather, it arises simply from *prāṇa*, a person's vital force. Thus the word *mahāprāṇa* connotes something that is naturally arisen from the vital force alone.  


Great feast[^30-1] who takes the form of great passion,  
Producing bliss in every sentient being,  
Great feast who takes the form of great anger,  
Great enemy of every mental poison, (30)  

[^30-1]: We use the word 'feast' in the sense of a festival, particularly one that involves religious worship.  


Great feast who is by nature great delusion,  
Delusion's vanquisher for deluded minds,  
Great feast who is in essence great fury,  
Great adversary to all furiousness, (31)  

Great feast who takes the form of great desire,  
Who vanquishes desire in all forms;  
He is great carnal lust; he is great bliss;  
He is great happiness; he is great joy; (32)  

With great appearance, bearing forms supreme,  
With great complexion, marked by great physique,  
With great renown, the great munificent one,  
Ruling a great and spacious *maṇḍala*, (33)  

The holder of the great weapon of wisdom,  
The foremost goad for taming great afflictions,  
Of great glory, possessing great renown,  
With brightness great, with lustre most supreme, (34)  


Most wise upholder of the great illusion,  
Fulfiller of the great illusion's aims,  
Raptured by rapture from the great illusion,  
The great illusion's great illusionist, (35)  

The foremost lord of great munificence,[^36-1]  
Supreme upholder of great discipline,  
Steady maintainer of great tolerance,  
With valour rooted in great diligence, (36)  

[^36-1]: Beginning in this verse the tantra lists the ten *pāramitā*s: 1. generosity; 2. discipline; 3. patience ('tolerance'); 4. diligence; 5. meditative concentration; 6. wisdom; 7. skilful means; 8. strength; 9. aspiration; and 10. knowledge.  


Fixed in *samādhi* with great concentration,  
Bearing the body formed from great wisdom,  
Most great in strength, with skilfully great means,  
A brimming ocean filled with vows and knowledge, (37)  


Boundless in being suffused with great kindness,  
Enriched with great compassion, the foremost mind,  
The great wise one, the great intelligent one,  
Great dexterous one, with methods ever great, (38)  


Commanding powers and great miracles,  
Wielding great driving force, with speed most great,  
Renowned great lord, of majesty supreme,  
Most valorous owing to his great strength, (39)  


Smashing the massive mountain of becoming;  
Forever firm through holding his great vajra;  
Great terrifying lord, the great cruel one;  
Provoking fear in fearsome, great creatures;[^40-1] (40)  

[^40-1]: Vimalamitra understands what we translate as "fearsome, great creatures" (Skt. *mahābhaya*; Tib. *'jigs chen*) to refer to non-Buddhist gods such as Viṣṇu and Śiva. Vilāsavajra, similarly, understands the word to refer to Śiva in his Mahābhairava form.  

Protector as the best of great *vidyā*s,[^41-1]  
Guru in being the best of great *mantra*s,  
Riding along the Mahāyāna's path,  
Himself the Mahāyāna's foremost way; (41)  
  
[^41-1]: Here we believe that the majority of witnesses of the Tibetan translations have suffered from corruption, with the word '*rig*' becoming '*rigs*'. Following the corrupted text, we may translate the name, 'the best of the great families'. This reading, along with its interpretations, appears to be common in Tibetan commentaries, including that of Vimalamitra. Witnesses of the text reading '*rig*' (*vidyā*) can also be found, and these are almost certainly to be regarded as correct.  

## 6. The wisdom of the immaculate *dharmadhātu*  

He is Vairocana, the great Buddha;  
Great sage; observing great, intensive silence;[^42-1]  
Arising from the Way of Great Mantra;  
He is the Way of Great Mantra in essence; (42)  

[^42-1]: At face value, the Tibetan could be taken to mean 'endowed with great sageness'.  


Accomplished in the ten *pāramitā*s,  
Having the ten *pāramitā*s as home,  
In whom the ten *pāramitā*s are pure,  
For whom the ten *pāramitā*s are means, (43)  


Protector, reigning over all ten grounds,[^44-1]  
On all ten grounds residing steadily,  
Made pure in nature by the tenfold knowledge,[^44-2]  
With tenfold knowledge bearing purity, (44)  

[^44-1]: The ten grounds (*bhūmi*s) refer to stages of the path to awakening that a bodhisattva traverses after having a perceptual realisation of highest reality.  
[^44-2]: The ten knowledges (Skt. *daśa jñānāni*; Tib. *shes pa bcu*) are mentioned, for example, in Vasubandhu's *Abidharmakośa* ch. 7. They are as follows: knowledge of 1. dharma; 2. concordance; 3. conventions; 4. other minds; 5. suffering; 6. origin; 7. cessation; 8. the path; 9. exhaustion; 10. non-arising.  


With tenfold forms, intent on ten referents,[^45-1]  
With tenfold strength,[^45-2] omnipresent, sage lord,  
Achieving every aim of every being,  
Endowed with tenfold mastery,[^45-3] supreme, (45)  

[^45-1]: Commentators interpret these enumerations variously: Vilāsavajra understands the "ten forms" to be the ten ways of grasping to the self, which are taught in the third chapter of the *Madhyāntavibhāga*, and he understands the "ten referents" to be their remedies—i.e., the ten topics of mastery (which are mentioned in the same work, and which also serve as the main topics of Mipham Rinpoche's *Gateway to Knowledge*). Vilāsavajra further explains that Mañjuśrī receives such names because he can appear both as phenomena that are in discord with awakening and as the remedies to such phenomena. Vimalamitra, by contrast, takes the "ten forms" to be the five aggregates and the five mental afflictions, and the "ten referents" to be the five wisdoms and five bodies.  
[^45-2]: The `ten strength' refer ten types of knowledge called the powers (or strengths) of a *tathāgata* (Skt. *tathāgatabala*; Tib. *de bzhin gshegs pa'i stobs*)—namely, knowledge of 1. what is correct and incorrect; 2. the results of actions; 3. the diverse aspirations of beings; 4. the diverse dispositions of beings; 5. the quality of beings' acumens; 6. the paths that lead in all directions; 7. all forms of meditative concentration and the like; 8. past lives; 9. death and rebirth; and 10. the destruction of defilements.    
[^45-3]: Vilāsavajra and Vimalamitra both understand this to refer to the ten masteries (*vaśitā*; Tib. *dbang*)—namely the power over 1. life; 2. mind; 3. material provisions; 4. action; 5. birth; 6. aspirations; 7. resolve; 8. supernatural powers; 9. Dharma; and 10. knowledge.  


Beginningless, complexity devoid,  
By nature pure, reality in essence,  
A speaker of the truth, unwavering,  
With speech and actions perfectly aligned, (46)  

Non-dual, a teacher of the non-dual truth,  
Mounted atop reality's summit,  
With lion-like no self as his great roar,  
Instilling fear in deer-like misled seekers,[^47-1] (47)  

[^47-1]: 'Seekers' (Skt. *tīrthya*; Tib. *mu stegs*) refer to those who seek liberation from suffering. They are described as 'misled' or 'bad' insofar as they do not follow the Buddhist path, and they are 'deer-like' because they are terrified by the roar of the lion-like 'no self' doctrine.  


With journeys fruitful, travelling everywhere,[^48-1]  
As swift as thought in all *tathāgata*s,  
A victor, triumphant, slayer of foes,  
A universal king, with forces great,[^48-2] (48)  

[^48-1]: Based on Vimalamitra's commentary, which contains an alternatively reading of the text found only in certain witnesses of the Tibetan translation (*kun tu 'gro ba'i don yod stobs*), we may translate the first quarter as, 'he who has strength that is fruitful for all beings'.   
[^48-2]: Here 'force' (*bala*; Tib. *stobs*) is most naturally understood in the sense of military force.  


Assembly head, instructor for assemblies,  
Assembly lord, assembly chief, great ruler,  
Most influential, bearing precious burdens,  
Not other-bound, his way the greatest way, (49)  


The lord of speech, the master of expression,  
Most skilled with words, adept with language, truthful,  
With boundless words, the teacher of the truth,  
Providing teachings on the fourfold truth, (50)  


Not coming back, not turning back, rhino,  
The leader of the *pratyekabuddha*s,[^51-1]  
Gone forth by going forth in different ways,  
The single cause of all great elements, (51)  

[^51-1]: Vilāsavajra explains that "rhino" refers to the *pratyekabuddha*s who lead solitary lives, whereas the following refers to *pratyekabuddha*s who congregate in groups.  


*Bhikṣu*, *arhat*, defilements exhausted,  
Devoid of passion, master of the senses,  
Arrived at comfort, met with security,  
For he, having cooled down, is free from stains; (52)  

Fully equipped with knowledge and its feet,[^53-1]  
A *sugata*, best knower of the world,  
Not thinking 'me', not clinging onto 'mine',  
Established in the system of two truths, (53)  

[^53-1]: This term (vidyācaraṇasampanna; Tib. rig pa dang zhabs su/rkang par ldan pa) is a stock epithet for the Buddha and refers to knowledge and good conduct, or, more technically, the Eightfold Path of the Nobles (namely, knowledge refers to right view, and its "feet" or supporting factors are the remaining seven branches.  


Upon the edge of cyclic life's far shore;  
With deeds accomplished; resting on the bank;  
Emerging from untainted, lone awareness;  
With sword-like insight ever penetrating; (54)	


Sublime Dharma, the Dharma king, the sun,  
Supreme illuminator of the world,  
The Dharma lord, the sovereign of the Dharma,  
The teacher of the way to excellence, (55)  


Accomplishing all goals,[^56-1] fulfilling wishes,  
Completely free from wants of any kind,  
Bereft of thought, an undepleting source,  
The Dharma source,[^56-1] supreme, beyond decay, (56)  

[^56-1]: "Accomplishing all goals" translates the Sanskrit *siddhārtha*, also a well-known name of Buddha Śākyamuni.  
[^56-2]: "The Dharma source" translates the Sanskrit *dharmadhātu*. An alternative translation could, for instance, the Dharma sphere.  


Enriched by merit; merit's gathering;  
Unique, great wisdom; wisdom; wisdom-rich;  
Aware of what exists and what does not;  
While gathering the twofold gathering; (57)  


Eternal, *yogin*, king of everywhere,  
The object and the mind of concentration,  
The master of intelligent reflection—  
For by oneself alone is he experienced—  
Immovable, the ultimate beginning,  
The holder of the three enlightened bodies, (58)  


The Buddha, formed of five embodiments,[^59-1]  
The omnipresent, made of five wisdoms,  
Wearing a crown comprised of five buddhas,  
With all five eyes,[^59-2] upholding non-attachment, (59)  

[^59-1]: Four of these five bodies are the *dharmakāya*, *svabhāvakāya*, *sambhogakāya*, and *nirmāṇakāya*. The fifth is given variously as 'the body of ripening' (*vipākakāya*), 'the body of wisdom-dharma' (**jñānadharmakāya*), or the vajra body (*vajrakāya*). Vilāśavajra refers to the first of these, whereas Vimalamitra refers to the fourth.  
[^59-2]: The five eyes, which are five organs of superior vision, are the bodily eye, divine eye, insight eye, dharma eye, and buddha's eye.  


The great progenitor of all the buddhas,  
The buddhas' eminent and foremost son,  
Arising from the world that is insight,  
The sourceless, Dharma source, existence ending, (60)  


Comprised of vajras, wholly firm and dense,  
The newborn sovereign ruler of the world,  
Emerging from the sky, the self arisen,  
A massive blaze of knowledge and insight, (61)  

Illuminating,[^62-1] beacon of great light,  
A lamp of wisdom, shining brilliantly,  
A light for beings, a lantern unto wisdom,  
With energy supreme, most radiant, (62)  

[^62-1]: Vairocana. The name Mahāvairocana occurs in verse 42.  


The *vidyā* king, the greatest mantra's lord,  
The mantra king, achieving noble aims,  
The great *uṣṇīṣa*, marvellous *uṣṇīṣa*,  
The lord of space, revealer of all things, (63)  


The best embodiment of every buddha,  
With eyes the joy of every living being,  
Creator, manifesting varied forms,  
Great sage, most praiseworthy, most venerable, (64)  


Upholder of the triple family,[^65-1] *mantrin*,  
Bearing the mantra for the foremost pledge,[^65-2]  
The foremost holder of the triple gem,  
The teacher of the three supreme *yāna*s; (65)  

[^65-1]: The three families are those of Body, Speech, and Mind.  
[^65-2]: The foremost pledge (or great *samaya*) may, as Vilāsavajra suggests, refer to a deity, or it may refer more generally to the pledges of the Vajrayāna.  


With snare unfailing, most victorious,  
The snatcher ever great, the vajra snare,  
The vajra hook, the snare forever supreme.[^66-1]  

[^66-1]: A number of names in this verse correspond to well-known deities: Amoghapāśa (translated as 'with snare unfailing') is a form of Lokeśvara, while Vajrapāśa (translated as 'the vajra snare') and Vajrāṅkuśa (translated as 'the vajra hook') are found as door-keepers in a number of *maṇḍala*s.  

## 7. The mirror-like wisdom  
He is terrific, Vajrabhairava, (66)  


Six-faced, the king of anger,[^67-1] hideous,  
Six-eyed, six-armed, the ever powerful,  
Baring his terrible fangs, a skeleton,  
Halāhala,[^67-2] a hundred faces proud, (67)  

[^67-1]: Alternatively, 'King of wrathful deities'.  
[^67-2]: Halāhala is the poison that, according to Hindu mythology, was produced during the churning of the ocean.  


The Yama killer,[^68-1] ruling obstacles,[^68-2]  
Instilling fear, with vajra impetus,  
The vajra-hearted, famous for his vajra,  
With belly large, with vajras of illusion, (68)  

[^68-1]: This translates the name Yamāntaka. Yama can be understood as the personification of death or as death's messenger.  
[^68-2]: This translates the name Vighnarāja, a common epithet for Gaṇeśa.  


The vajra-born, the sovereign of the vajra,  
Bearing the vajra as his core, like space,  
Unmoving,[^69-1] haughty with his single dreadlock,  
His clothes an elephant hide still fresh and moist, (69)  

[^69-1]: This translates the name Acala.  


The great terrific one, who cries *hā hā*,  
Screaming *hī hī*, instilling fervent fear,  
Laughing a screeching laugh, a booming laugh,  
He is the vajra laugh, the mighty howl; (70)  


He is the noble *sattva*, Vajrasattva,  
The vajra's sovereign lord, the highest bliss,  
The vajra's wrathfulness, the highest joy,  
Voicing the *hūṁ*s of Vajrahūṁkāra, (71)  


Wielding a vajra arrow as his weapon,  
While slashing thoroughly, with vajra sword,  
Upholding every vajra, vajra bearing,  
With but a single vajra, ending conflict, (72)  


With eyes, like vajra fire, ever dreadful;  
With hair that's like a vajra set ablaze;  
Great entering;[^73-1] the entry of the vajra;  
With eyes like vajras; eyes a hundredfold; (73)  

[^73-1]: Here 'entering' (Skt. *āveśa*, Tib. *'bebs pa*) can be understood in the sense of 'empowerment', 'blessing', or 'possession'.  


With vajra hairs that sprout upon his form;  
His unique body marked by vajra hairs;  
With nails advancing, vajras at their tips;  
With skin that's firm as if a vajra’s core; (74)  


Wearing a vajra garland splendidly,[^75-1]  
Adorned with ornaments comprised of vajras,  
With booming voice, laughing his screech '*ha ha*',  
Six-syllabled, sounding a vajra rumble, (75)  

[^75-1]: Garland (mālā; phreng ba) may refer to a mālā in the sense of rosary.  


Great Mañjughoṣa, sound ever supreme,  
A roar unique unto the threefold world,  
The voice that reaches every bound of space,  
Pre-eminent amongst all voice-endowed. (76)  

## 8. The wisdom of discernment  

He is a being whose understood the truth,  
Reality, its peak, and selflessness;[^77-1]  
Best teacher showing emptiness; word free;[^77-2]  
Whose voice intones the teachings, deep and vast; (77)  

[^77-1]: According to Vilāśavajra, the meaning of this epithet is that Mañjuśrī has knowledge of these four: truth, reality, reality's peak, and selflessness (the commentator glosses these four as slightly different aspects of the ultimate reality).  
[^77-2]: Literally 'without letters'; the Sanskrit name can also mean 'imperishable'.   


The conch of Dharma, bolstering great sound,  
The gong of Dharma, greatly resonant,  
Reaching *nirvāṇa* in unbounded form,[^78-1]  
He is the Dharma drum of all ten quarters; (78)  

[^78-1]: 'Unbounded *nirvāṇa*' (*apratiṣṭhitanirvāṇa*; Tib. *mi gnas pa'i mya ngan las 'das pa*) refers to the state of liberation that is bound to neither *saṃsāra* nor utter quiescence. 	  

He's formless, bearing handsome form, supreme,  
Replete with diverse forms, comprised of mind,  
With splendour that appears in every form,  
While wielding power over all illusions, (79)  


Invincible, renowned as sovereign supreme,  
The sovereign supreme who rules the threefold world,  
Abiding on the nobles’ lofty path,  
Great source of flourishing, the Dharma's crown, (80)  


With youthful form unique within all worlds,  
The elder, senior, father of all beings,  
Adorned with thirty-two auspicious marks,  
Most beautiful, most handsome in all worlds, (81)	


The teacher of mundane virtues and knowledge,  
The teacher to all beings, most confident,  
The world’s trustworthy guide, protector, saviour,  
The refuge unsurpassed, the guardian, (82)  


With his enjoyments stretching throughout space,  
The knowledge-ocean of omniscient beings,  
Breaking the eggshell that is ignorance,  
Smashing the cage of cyclic existence, (83)  


Quelling intense affliction thoroughly,  
Reaching the shoreside of *saṃsāra*'s ocean,  
Wearing the crown of wisdom consecration,  
With perfect buddhas as his ornaments, (84)  


Soothing the pain of threefold suffering,  
Bringing the trio[^85-1] to an end, endless,  
Arriving at the threefold liberation,  
Completely free of every obscuration,  
Having achieved sky-like equality, (85)  

[^85-1]: For Vimalamitra, 'the trio' here refers to the three poisons. Vilāśavajra interprets this name as meaning 'the end of the three', and the three refer to the Truth of Suffering, the Truth of Origin, and the Truth of Cessation; thus, Mañjuśrī is identified as the end of these three, the Truth of the Path.   


Passing beyond affliction's every stain,  
Knowing the timelessness of all three times,   
Most eminent[^86-1] amongst all sentient beings,  
The crown amongst those crowned with fine virtues, (86)  

[^86-1]: Literally 'great elephant', or 'great *nāga*', 'amongst sentient beings'. The word *nāga* at the end of the compound frequently denotes pre-eminence in general.  


Completely free from substrates of all sorts,[^87-1]  
Well situated on the path of space,  
Holding a splendid wish-fulfilling jewel,  
The omnipresent, best of all that's precious, (87)  

[^87-1]: For the Nāmasaṅgīti, we translate *upadhi* as 'substrate', but the word as a technical Buddhist term has a number of possible meanings, depending on context. For example, it can also mean 'remainder', 'body', or 'afflictions'. Tibetan translations of the Nāmasaṅgīti and other texts render this term in various ways.  


Great wish-fulfilling tree, most plentiful,  
The greatest of all great auspicious vases,  
Doer, fulfilling aims of sentient beings,  
An ally, most beloved to all creatures, (88)  

Knower of good and bad, knower of times,  
The omnipresent knower of the pledges,  
Upholding *samaya*s, occasion knower,  
Knower of varied aptitudes in beings,  
Most skilled with liberation in three forms,[^89-1] (89)  

[^89-1]: According to both Vimalamitra and Vilāsavajra, the three forms of liberations are that of *śrāvaka*s, *pratyekabuddha*s, and buddhas.  

Virtued, knower of virtues, Dharma knower,  
Auspicious, source of all auspiciousness,  
Most auspicious of all that's auspicious,  
Great splendour, glory, good, and fine fortune; (90)  


Great reassurance, foremost celebration,  
Great joyouness, the highest form of pleasure,  
Abundance, reverence, action venerable,  
Great happines, the noble lord of splendour, (91)  


Wisdhed for, the greatest granter of what's wished,  
Refuge bestowing, highest source of refuge,  
The foremost enemy of potent danger,  
Alleviating danger in all forms, (92)  


With tufts of hair, with plumes of luscious hair,  
With matted hair, with matted locks, chord-tied,[^93-1]  
Wearing a crown, five faced, with five hair tufts,  
And crowned with flower garlands of five strands, (93)  

[^93-1]: 'Chord-wearing' (Skt. *mauñjin*) indicates that Mañjuśrī wears the sacred chord of a brahmin. In some witnesses of the text, this name is exchanged with the name *mauṇḍin* from the following verse, and this can be interpreted to mean that Mañjuśrī has a shaved head (as a renunciate) or that he carries a skull cup (as a practitioner of extreme asceticism). The Kangyur translation of the Nāmasaṅgīti indicates that *mauṇḍin* was read both in this verse and in the following. Regardless, commentators tend to agree that this portion of the text shows how Mañjuśrī can appear with the garb and appearance of various Buddhist and non-Buddhist religious practitioners.  


Upholding great observances, head shaven,  
Foremost in all observances, chaste student,  
With great austerities fully perfected,[^94-1]  
He is the greatest bather, Gautama; (94)  

[^94-1]: More precisely, here two names should be understood: 'he whose austerities are great' and 'he in whom austerities have culminated'.   


A brahmin, Brahmā, knower of *brahman*,[^95-1]  
Fully arrived at *brahman* *nirvāṇa*,  
Awakening, its branches,[^95-2] liberation,  
Release, complete tranquillity, quiescence,[^95-3] (95)  

[^95-1]: A 'brahmin' is a member of the bhramin caste, 'Brahmā' refers to the deity known by that name, and '*brahman*' can be understood as ultimate reality. Commentators vary in their accounts of how these conventionally 'Hindu' terms relate to Mañjuśrī.  
[^95-2]: Vilāsavajra comments that 'the branches of awakening' (Skt. *vimokṣaṅga*) are the seven branches of awakening and the eight-branched path of noble beings. Vimalamitra, perhaps led by the Tibetan rendering the term 'branch' as *lus* ('body'), interprets as meaning 'the body of awakening'—i.e., the body that is achieved on achieving full liberation.  
[^95-3]: The word *śiva* ('quiescence') may also be understood with the meaning 'good' or 'beneficial'; or, although it is not mentioned by commentators, the god who bears the name Śiva.  


He is *nirvāṇa*, calmness, peacefulness,  
Approaching well his entry to *nirvāṇa*,  
The culmination, ending pain and pleasure,   
The state devoid of passion, free from substrates, (96)  

Beyond defeat, unmanifest, unmatched,  
Not making manifest, and not appearing,  
Pervasive, timeless, fully omnipresent,  
Minute, beyond defilement, seed-free, (97)  


Unstained, devoid of passion, passionless,[^98-1]  
Controlling humours, free from every illness,  
By nature most awakened, fully awake,  
Omniscient, knowing everything, supreme, (98)  

[^98-1]: The names translated here as 'devoid of passion' and 'passionless' point toward the *guṇa* of *rajas*, from the triad of *sattva* (light/goodness), *rajas* (passion/energy), and *tamas* (darkness/inertia). This connection also suits the two names given in 98b, which connote freedom from disease related to the three humours (which are in turn based on the three *guṇa*s). The Tibetan translation of the word *rajas* (i.e., *rdul*), while also referring to the *guṇa* in a technical context, can equally imply either a minute particle or a fault (*nyes rkyon*).  


Beyond cognition as reality,  
Pristine awareness, bearing non-dual form,  
Beyond conceptualisation, effort-free,  
Acting as buddhas do in every age, (99)  

The Buddha, endless and beginningless,  
The Buddha at the start, devoid of sequence,  
With wisdom as his only eye, stainless,  
*Tathāgata*, with wisdom as his body, (100)  


Sovereign of every language, great debater,  
The king of discourse, best of orators,  
The best and greatest of communicators,  
The unassailable, lion of speech,  (101)  


With sight of all directions, true delight,  
With garlands of fierce energy, most handsome,  
The endless knot,[^102-1] most radiant, great lustre,  
With shining rays in hand, providing light; (102)  

[^102-1]: Alternatively, Mañjuśrī is 'Śrī's beloved' (*śrīvatsa*). According to Vailāsavajra, a mark which has the shape of a so-called endless knot is situated uniquely at the hearts of buddhas. Śrīvatsa is also a common epithet for Viṣṇu and the mark on his chest.   


The best of great physician, eminent,  
Unequalled in alleviating of pain,  
A tree providing every medicine,  
The foe opposing every malady, (103)  


The crowning jewel of all three worlds, lovely,   
A bright star cluster, ever glorious,  
The end of space in all its ten directions,  
Hoisting on high the Dharma's victory flag, (104)  

Sharing one large umbrella with the world,  
His *maṇḍala* being love and empathy,  
The lotus lord of dance,[^105-1] most glorious,  
Pervading with his precious parasol, (105)

[^105-1]: Padmanarteśvara, a name commonly associated with Lokeśvara.  


The energy most fierce of all the buddhas,   
Bearing a body shared by all the buddhas,  
Supreme union enjoyed with all the buddhas,  
The single teaching taught by all the buddhas, (106)  


Most glorious with Vajraratna's blessing,  
The highest sovereign lord of Sarvaratna,  
The ruler of Sarvalokeśvara,  
Supreme monarch of Sarvavajradhara, (107)  

The mind most excellent of Sarvabuddha,[^108-1]  
Residing in the mind of every buddha,  
The greatest body borne by every buddha,  
The lovely speech enriching every buddha, (108)  

[^108-1]: Vilāsavajra appears to treat Vajraratna and so on (i.e. the names in verse 107–108a) as proper names, and he, as Vimalamitra does too, identifies them with, respectively, Akṣobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitābha, Amoghasiddhi, and Vairocana.  


The scorching brightness of the vajra sun,  
With stainless lustre from the vajra moon,  
Great passion of the passion-free and others,  
With blazing rays of colours variegated, (109)  


The vajra posture of the perfect Buddha,  
Retaining for all beings the Buddha's Dharma,  
Most glorious, born of the lotus Buddha,  
Omniscient being's awareness treasurer, (110)  


Sovereign, controller of varied illusions,  
The greatest master of the Buddha's spells,  
He is Vajratikṣṇa, the mighty sword,  
Completely pure, the ultimate syllable; (111)  

With vajra-Dharma as his great weapon  
While on the Great Vehicle—pain's remedy,  
Rich in vajra profundity, Jinajik,  
With a vajra mind, knowing all as it is, (112)  


Perfecting all perfections thoroughly,  
Whom all the bodhisattva grounds adorn,   
The selflessness of pure phenomena,  
The moon of true knowledge with his bright light, (113)  


With great deeds from the Net of Illusion,  
The master over all tantras, supreme,   
Richly endowed with every vajra posture,  
Fully furnished with every wisdom body, (114)  


Completely good, with fine intelligence,  
The embryo of earth,[^115-1] sustaining beings,  
Great embryo from which all buddhas form,   
Whose emanation circles are diverse, (115)  

[^115-1]: The first three names mentioned in this verse are also the names of well-known bodhisattvas: Samantabhadra, Sumati, and Kṣitigarbha.  


The highest nature of all that exists,  
Supportive of the nature of all things,  
With *dharma*s unarisen, with goals for all,   
Supportive of the nature of all *dharma*s, (116)  


And bearing knowledge of all phenomena  
In but an instant as the most wise one,  
Realising vividly all phenomena,  
He is a sage, with great intelligence,   
One vanquishing all hosts of evil spirits, (117)  


Unwavering, completely pure in nature,  
Holding the true Buddha's awakening,  
Being the direct perception of all buddhas,  
He is the flame of wisdom, most luminous; (118)  

## 9. The wisdom of equality   

The great fulfiller of desired aims,  
The purifier of all evil states,  
Protector, greatest of all living beings,   
Who liberates all beings with great vigour, (119)  

Unmatched hero in battle with afflictions,    
Crushing the pride of ignorance—the enemy,   
The glorious mind[^120-1] grasping amorousness,   
Bearing repulsive and heroic forms, (120)  

[^120-1]: Or, alternatively, 'the glorious letter *dhīḥ*'.  


The dancer moving his many hundreds  
Of lengthy arms while setting down his stride,  
The dancer who covers the whole of space  
And fills it with Śrīmat’s one hundred arms,[^121-1] (121)  

[^121-1]: According to Vilāśavajra, Śrīmat refers to Padmanarteśvara, who is mentioned in verse 105.  


Standing atop the surface of the earth  
That's covered by just one of his foot soles,  
Standing atop the summit of the world [^122-1]  
And holding it just with his big toenail, (122)  

[^122-1]: The Sanskrit word translated here as 'the world' is *brahmāṇḍa*, lit. 'Brahmā egg', a term more commonly in non-Buddhist texts in reference to the universe.   


Whose aim is one; whose aim is non-dual Dharma;  
Eternal one; whose aim is ultimate;   
Whose mind consists in groups of consciousness  
With varied cognisance, objects, and forms; (123)  


Enjoying every object of existence,   
A passion-filled mind, relishing emptiness,  
Transcending worldly passion and the like,  
Taking great pleasure in the threefold world, (124)  


White in complexion like pristine white clouds,  
With radiance like beams from autumn moons,  
With lustre equal to the morning sun's,  
With nails projecting light with deep redness,[^125-1] (125)  

[^125-1]: Or 'of great passion' (mahārāga).  

Whose handsome crown has sterling sapphires,  
Whose hair has tips of deep sapphire blue,  
With glory from the light of his great jewel,  
Adorned with emanations of the buddhas, (126)  


The shaker of a hundred worldly realms,  
Having miraculous power as strength,[^127-1]   
Suchness, maintainer of great mindfulness,  
*Samādhi* king of fourfold mindfulness,[^127-2] (127)  

[^127-1]: The four bases of miraculous powers (Skt. *caturṛddhipāda*, Tib. *rdzu 'phrul gyi rkang pa bzhi*) are: 1. intention (canda, 'dun pa); 2. diligence (vīrya, brtson 'grus); 3. attention (citta, sems pa); and 4. discernment (mīmāṃsā, dpyod pa).  
[^127-2]: The four applications of mindfulness (catuḥ-smṛtyupasthāna, dran pa nye bar bzhag pa bzhi) are mindfulness of 1. body (kāya, lus), 2. feelings (vedanā, tshor ba), 3. mind (citta, sems), and 4. phenomena (dharma, chos).  

Fragrant with flowers of bodhi's branches,  
An ocean of *thathāgata* qualities,  
Knowing the journey of the eightfold path,   
Knowing the path of true and perfect buddhas, (128)  


The great attachment of all living beings,  
Attachment-free, comparable to space,  
When springing up in every creatures mind,  
He is, for every being, as swift as mind; (129)  


Knowing the aptitude of every being,   
And captivating every creature's mind,    
Knowing the essence of the aggregated,[^130-1]  
Himself with fully pure five aggregates, (130)  

[^130-1]: A more literal translation may be, 'he who know the reality of the objects [subsumed in] the five aggregates'.   

Reaching the endpoint of all going forth,  
Skilful at going forth in every way,    
Established on all paths of going forth,  
Teacher of going forth in all its forms, (131)  


Using the twelve links to uproot becoming,  
Bearing the fully purified twelve forms, [^132-1]  
His own form being the way of fourfold truth,   
He is one who has gained the eightfold knowledge; [^132-2] (132)  

[^132-1]: According to the commentators, this refers to the twelve sense sources (āyatana, skye mched) in their pure forms.  
[^132-2]: These eight knowledges are understood by Vilāsavajra as follows: knowledge of Dharma, knowledge of non-duality, knowledge of suffering, knowledge of the origin, knowledge of cessation, knowledge of the path, knowledge of destruction, and knowledge of non-arising. Vimalamitra, however, offers another interpretation: Mañjuśrī realises that the eight forms of consciousness (from eye consciousness through to the storehouse consciousness) are unarisen.  


Bearing the truth's meaning in twelve aspects,[^133-1]  
Knowing reality in sixteen forms,[^133-2]  
Whose great awakening has twenty forms,[^133-3]   
The true Buddha, omniscient, most supreme, (133)  

[^133-1]: Vilāsavajra identifies these twelve aspects as the forms of the Four Truths as divided across the three turnings of the wheel of Dharma. Vimalamitra, by contrast, enumerates the twelve as the five families (*rigs lnga*), the five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*), and insight (*shes rab*) and compassion (*snying rje*).  
[^133-2]: Vilāsavajra explains that sixteen forms referred to here are sixteen moments of realisation of the Four Truths on the Path of Seeing. Vimalamitra, by contrast, enumerates these as the sixteen varieties of emptiness.  
[^133-3]: Vilāsavajra enumerates these twenty forms as four ways in which each of the five aggregates are not conceptualised. For example, by achieving awakening, one does not believe that (1) material form is the self, (2) the self is within material form, (3) material form is within the self, or (4) material form possesses the self. Multiple by five aggregates, these add up to twenty forms. Vimalamitra, on the other hand, understands these twenty forms as the transformation of the five elements, of the five aggregates, of the five afflictions, and of the five faculties.  

Dispatching some ten million buddha bodies  
With emanations inconceivable,  
The final realisation of all moments,  
Knowing for every mind each moment’s object, (134)  


And manifesting for the sake of beings   
With means derived from varied vehicles,  
Having gone forth on all three vehicles,  
Abiding in the single vehicle’s fruit, (135)  


With purified afflictive spheres[^136-1] at heart,  
Annihilator of all karmic spheres,  
Having traversed all oceanic floods,[^136-2]   
Having emerged from yoga's dark forest,[^136-3] (136)  

[^136-1]: Vilāsavajra unpacks 'afflictive spheres' as referring to the eighteen spheres (*dhātu*, *khams*) beginning the eye sphere.  
[^136-2]: Vilāsavajra explains that 'oceanic floods' are the traditionally enumerated four floods—namely, the floods of desire, cyclic existence, views, and ignorance.   
[^136-3]: Vilāsavajra explains that here the practice of *yoga* is compared to a 'dark forest' because it is not easily traversed; Mañjuśrī has emerged from the practice of *yoga* and has arrived the state of *nirvāṇa*.   

Casting off general, minor and complete  
Afflictions and their latent tendencies;  
Having great insight, means, and empathy;  
Achieving fruitful aims for living beings; (137)  

Being object-free by means of all perceptions,[^138-1]  
With consciousness as object, with cessation,  
Holding all beings as objects of his mind,   
His knowledge being the mind of all the buddhas, (138)  

[^138-1]: According to Vilāsavajra, the words 'all perceptions' (*sarvasaṃjñā*) refer to certain forms of mundane meditative concentration. Through these meditations, Mañjuśrī enters a state of objectless awareness.   


Residing in the mind of every being,  
Having become their minds' equality,  
And satisfying the mind of every being,  
He is for every being great mental joy; (139)  


Confusion-free regarding points of doctrine,[^140-1]   
Lacking erroneousness in all its forms,  
With doubt-free thinking, knowing three objects,  
With all objects, three properties by nature,[^140-2] (140)  

[^140-1]: An alternate reading and interpretation of this verse may read, 'one who has reached the end of accomplishment, confusion free'.    
[^140-2]: Vilāsavajra explains the final three cryptic names here as follows: 'three objects' are the past, present, and future; 'all objects' are all objects of the animate and inanimate world; and the 'three properties' are the three *guṇa*s extensively described in Sāṅkhya philosophy.   


With objects of the five *skandha*s, three times,  
Discerning thoroughly moment by moment,   
Awakening in but a single moment,   
His nature being equal to all buddhas, (141)  


His body bodiless, the best of bodies,  
Having realised the pinnacle of bodies,  
Displaying his forms of every possible kind,  
He is the great gem, most precious stone; (142)  

## 10. The wisdom of performing actions   

To be realised by all of the buddhas,  
The buddhas' unsurpassed awakening,  
Devoid of syllables, yet born of mantra,  
Bred of Great Mantra's threefold lineage,[^143-1] (143)  

[^143-1]: According to Vilāsavajra, the three lineages (i.e. families) are those of Vairocana, Akṣobhya, and Amitābha.  

The father to the meaning of all mantras,  
The great *bindu*, bereft of syllables,  
Five syllabled, the greatest empty one,[^144-1]  
*Bindu*-void, with a hundred syllables,[^144-2] (144)  

[^144-1]: Vilāsavajra and Vimalamitra both identify these syllables as the seeds of the five *tathāgata*s, but they diverge regarding precisely how these syllables are to be identified.  
[^144-2]: Some witnesses of the text in Sanskrit and Tibetan indicate that the name is 'one with six syllables'. Vilāsavajra identifies the six syllables as 'oṁ vāgiśvara hūṁ', while Vimalamitra, reading 'one with a hundred syllables', interprets the hundred syllables as a generic large number that points to all the various mantras for which Mañjuśrī is the source.  

Endowed with every form, but free from form,  
Bearing the half of half of sixteen *bindu*s,[^145-1]  
Without members, transcending every grouping,  
Grasping the summit of the fourth *dhyāna*. (145)  

[^145-1]: Vilāsavajra refrains from offering a commentary on this line, but Vimalamitra clarifies that the four drops/*bindu*s (i.e. 'half of half of sixteen') are the seed syllables *a ā aṃ aḥ*. This being a commonly quoted verse, a variety of highly esoteric interpretations can be found.  


Knowing the *dhyāna*'s each and every aspect,  
Knowing *samādhi*s' pedigrees and families,  
The best of bodies as the *samādhi* body,   
The king of every body of enjoyment, (146)  


The best of bodies—emanation body,  
The heir to emanations of the buddhas,  
With varied emanations everywhere,  
While benefiting all, however needed, (147)  


The sovereign of the gods, the god of gods,  
The lord of *asura*s, a deity ruler,  
The sovereign of immortals, guru of gods,  
The highest lord of *pramatha*s,[^148-1] Pramatha, (148)  

[^148-1]: Pramathas are a class of being otherwise known as *gaṇa*s. They are known as serving as attendants to Śiva.   


Crossing the gloomy forest of existence,  
The single teacher, guru of all beings,  
In every directions of well-known worlds  
He is the greatest teacher of the Dharma; (149)   


Armoured in armour made of loving-kindness;  
And shielded by the shield of his compassion;  
Holding a wisdom sword, arrow, and bow;   
Ending the war with ignorance and *kleśa*s; (150)  

Hero, the *māra*s' enemy and tamer,   
Dispeller of the four *māra*s' danger,  
Defeater of all armies of *mārā*s,  
The true buddha, a guide to living beings, (151)  


Worthy of reverence and respect-worthy,  
Worthy of homage, always honourable,  
Worthy of worship and most highly adored,  
Worthy of obeisance, the highest guru, (152)  


Spanning three worlds with just a single stride,  
His step reaching the boundary of space,   
Knowing the three,[^153-1] well versed, and purified,  
With six knowledges and six recollections, (153)  

[^153-1]: The three names in this verse quarter evoke the Vedic learning of a Brahman. Vilāsavajra understands 'Knowing the three' to refer to the three vedas: Ṛgveda, Yajurveda, and Sāmaveda. Vimalamitra comments that the three are the scriptures of the *tripiṭaka*, or else three bodies of a buddha.  


The bodhisattva and mahāsattva,   
With great power, transcending worldly life,  
Perfected from perfecting his insight,  
Having obtained insight's reality, (154)  


Knowing himself, knowing others, the whole,  
For, wholly beneficial, he's man's best;  
Surpassing all points of comparison,  
The greatest master of knowledge and knowing, (155)  


The foremost master of bestowing Dharma,   
Teaching the meaning of the fourfold seal,  
Supremely venerable amongst all beings  
Engaged in going forth on the three paths, (156)  


With glory purified by ultimate truth,  
Most fortunate within the threefold world,  
The glorious provider of all wealth,  
The best amongst the glorious, Mañjuśrī. (157)  

## 11. Praise for the wisdom of the five *tathāgata*s.

Homage to you, boon granter, best of vajras;  
The summit of existence, homage to you;  
Homage to you, whose source is emptiness;  
O Buddha's awakening, homage to you; (158)

O passion of the buddhas, homage to you;  
Desire of the buddhas, I pay you homage;  
O love of every buddha, homage to you;  
The joy of all the buddhas, I pay you homage; (159)


O smile of every buddha, homage to you;  
The laugh of all the buddhas, I pay to you homage;  
O speech of every buddha, homage to you;  
The heart of all the buddhas, I pay to you homage; (160)  

Arisen from non-being, homage to you;  
Homage to you, arisen from the buddhas;  
Arisen from the sky, homage to you;  
Homage to you, born of pristine wisdom; (161)

O net of illusion, homage to you;  
Homage to you, the buddhas' spectacle;  
Homage to you, the everything of all;  
O body of wisdom, homage to you! (162)

*oṁ sarva-dharmābhāva-svabhāva viśuddha-vajra a ā aṃ aḥ | prakṛti-pariśuddhāḥ sarva-dharmā yad uta sarva-tathāgata-jñāna-kāya-mañjuśrī-pariśuddhitām upādāyeti a āḥ | sarva-tathāgata-hṛdayaṃ hara hara | oṁ hūṁ hrīḥ bhagavan jñāna-mūrti vāg-īśvara mahā-vāca sarva-dharma gaganāmala-supariśuddha-dharma-dhātu-jñāna-garbha āḥ |*[^162-m]  

[^162-m]: *Oṁ*! O you whose nature is the absence of all phenomena, whose vajra-essence is completely pure—*a ā aṃ aḥ*! All phenomena are by nature fully pure—to explain, they are fully pure based on state of complete purity that is Mañjuśrī, the wisdom body of all *tathāgata*s—*a āḥ*! Seize, seize the heart of all tathāgatas. *Oṁ hūṃ hrīḥ*! O Blessed One, wisdom body, lord of speech whose speech is great, he who is all Dharma, whose essence is the wisdom of the Dharma realm that's completely pure like stainless space—*āḥ*!


And then Vajradhara, the glorious,  
Most pleased and satisfied, with folded palms,  
Prostrated to the Buddha, the noble guard,   
The Blesssed One, the lord *tathāgata*; (163)  

And with a host of other Vajrapāṇis—  
Of varied forms, the lords of *guhyaka*s,   
Sublime protectors, noble wrathful kings—   
He then exlaimed this most exuberent praise: (164)  


Protector, we rejoice! How excellent!  
It's truly excellent what you have taught!  
By you our lofty aim has been achieved,  
Which leads to true and full awakening; (165)  

And so the aims of helpless mundane beings,  
Who seek the fruits of perfect liberation.  
Just this, taught in the *Māyājāla*'s system,  
Is the pure path that leads to excellence: (166)   

With largeness, vastness, and profundity,  
With meaning great, achieving beings' aims,  
Just this makes up the sphere of every buddha  
That's taught by all the true awakened ones. (167)  

## Colophon:

This concludes the supreme chanting of the names of the Blessed One Mañjuśrī, the wisdom deity. Extracted from the noble *Net of Illusion*, a *mahāyoga* tantra in sixteen thousand parts, from its chapter on the net of *samādhi*, it was spoken by the Blessed One Śākyamuni, the *tathāgata*.
